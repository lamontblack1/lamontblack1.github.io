        <!-- Some information about me -->
        <p>I'm a flip-flop-wearing Sarasotan who tries to step foot on the beach no less than 5 times a week. Sunrise and Sunset are the best times to do so - but remember to always look 360 degrees around you, not just at the immediate center of attention.</p>
        <p>My background is mathematics and physics. I am fascinated with the perfect settings, known as constants, that make the universe  and living things tick with precise balance. I have worked in such varied environments as carpentry and surgical technology. However, the pursuit which has taken up the bulk of my time for the past 9 years is learning the Mandarin language and volunteering to help Mandarin-speaking people understand, not how, but just why the universe does tick with such precision</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that I am not a daisy-chain thinker, I have used basic programming languages at a novice level since I had a Commodore 64. In 2021 I jumped into the world of web development. Perhaps my varied background may give me an edge on your project.  Give me a shot!</p>
